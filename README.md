BetBot
======

A python bot using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to place bets on virtual football matches on www.bet365.com following a scheme similar to the ladder bet. The bot also crawls statistics for the same games on the same site, and makes a summary of them. From there one can see that the scheme is not able to work as intended.
